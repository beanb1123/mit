# CrystalMine

An XMR pool miner implemented in Node.js, **for educational purpose**. It's by no means a fast miner, so don't use it for actual mining.

### Why?

- Almost all CryptoCurrency miners are written in C/C++, which is great in performance, but it can be hard for people interested in implementing a miner to read the source code. CrystalMine is written with readability in mind, and leaving only the minimal function, so it should be pretty easy to read and understand.
- Most of other miners are licensed under GPL, which is quite strict, while CrystalMine is licensed under MIT.

### Usage

- Edit `config.js`
- Run `node index.js`
- Enjoy your mining!
